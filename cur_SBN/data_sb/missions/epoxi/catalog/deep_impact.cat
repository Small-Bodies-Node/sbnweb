  Mission Overview                                                            
  ================                                                            
    The goal of the Deep Impact mission was to understand the physical        
    and chemical properties of a comet as a function of depth below the       
    surface.  To reach this goal, Deep Impact reproduced the impact of        
    a boulder onto a cometary nucleus at a hypervelocity speed,               
    characteristic of collisions in the asteroid belt.  The mission           
    delivered an impactor spacecraft of approximately 360 kg onto the         
    nucleus of 9P/Tempel 1 at a relative speed of 10.3 km/s.  The kinetic     
    energy of the impactor, about 19 gigajoules, produced a crater with       
    a diameter between 100 and 250 meters in about 200 seconds (A'Hearn,      
    et al. (2005) [AHEARNETAL2005A], Schultz and Ernst (2005)                 
    [SCHULTZ&ERNST2005], Richardson, et al. (2005) [RICHARDSONETAL2005]),     
    and Busko, et al. (2007) [BUSKOETAL2007]).  The impact was imaged by      
    the three instruments on board the flyby spacecraft.  The best            
    estimate of the impact time was 4 July 2005 at 05:44:34 UTC at the        
    flyby spacecraft (Earth-observed time 05:52:00 UTC).  The phase angle     
    on approach for both spacecraft was about 62.9 degrees.                   
                                                                              
    Deep Impact consisted of two spacecraft launched together on              
    12 January 2005 at 18:47:08.57 UTC and which flew together until          
    one day before impact on 4 July 2005.  On July 3 at 05:59:58 UTC,         
    the two spacecraft separated while on a course to impact comet            
    Tempel 1.  They immediately went into auto-navigation mode using          
    an algorithm that ensured the impactor would hit an illuminated           
    area of the nucleus and the flyby spacecraft would point to the           
    same area for imaging the impact.  The impactor observed the comet        
    with a visible CCD (ITS) until several seconds before the impact.         
    Shortly after separation, the flyby spacecraft performed a trajectory     
    correction maneuver and passed approximately 500 km below the             
    nucleus, as seen from the sun.  The flyby spacecraft recorded the         
    encounter and the impact with the High Resolution telescope's visible     
    CCD (HRIV) and infrared imaging spectrometer (HRII) as well as with       
    the Medium Resolution telescope's visible CCD (MRI).  Initial results     
    from the encounter were discussed by A'Hearn, et al. (2005)               
    [AHEARNETAL2005A].  Detailed results were presented later in              
    volume 187 of Icarus (March 2007), dedicated specifically to              
    Deep Impact.                                                              
                                                                              
    The mission, science objectives, instrumentation, and expected            
    results were described in a special edition of Space Science Reviews      
    (SSR) dedicated to Deep Impact.  See A'Hearn, et al. (2005)

    Calibration of Deep Impact instruments and the calibration

    This calibration paper was included on the Deep Impact documentation      
    volume, DIDOC_0001.                                                       
                                                                              
                                                                              
    Known Clock Discrepancy                                                   
    -----------------------                                                   
      There is a known one- or two-second uncertainty in the time             
      of the impact.  Clock correlation packets indicated large drifts        
      in the clocks on-board the flyby and impactor spacecraft due to         
      thermal changes induced by trajectory correction maneuvers near         
      encounter.  The drifts resulted in a difference of several              
      seconds between impact times based on data from the flyby and           
      impactor spacecraft and ground-based data.                              
                                                                              
      During January 2006 the project used available spacecraft data and      
      advice from engineering personnel to correlate the flyby clock and      
      Dynamical Barycentric Time (TDB) to within one or two seconds and       
      the flyby and impactor clocks to one-half of a second.  The project     
      moved the estimated impact time forward by two seconds, from            
      05:44:36 UTC on 4 July 2005 as reported by A'Hearn, et al. (2005)       
      [AHEARNETAL2005A] to 05:44:34.265 UTC at the flyby spacecraft and       
      05:44:34.200 UTC at the impactor spacecraft.  The project also          
      generated self-consistent SPICE CK kernels based on this analysis.      
                                                                              
      The improved kernels were included in the Deep Impact SPICE data        
      set archived in the PDS.  The timing discrepancy is discussed in        
      the 'Deep Impact Spacecraft Clock  Correlation' report included         
      on the Deep Impact documentation volume, DIDOC_0001.                    
                                                                              
                                                                              
  Mission Phases                                                              
  ==============                                                              
    Three primary phases are defined for the archive of flight-related        
    data:  thermal-vacuum ground calibrations (TV), cruise, and 9P            
    encounter.  A post-encounter phase is included below because              
    the Deep Impact SPICE archive includes a SP-kernel providing              
    the trajectory of the flyby spacecraft through 2009 and another           
    providing the ephemeris of 9P/Tempel 1 through 2050.

      Data acquired during ground-based thermal-vacuum tests TV1 through      
      TV4 were archived in the PDS.  The science team used these data for     
      pre-flight calibration analysis.  TV5 data were not used for science    
      calibrations but may be be archived at a future data.

      The cruise phase began at the lift-off of the launch vehicle. This      
      phase included checkout of the HRII, HRIV, and MRI instruments in       
      the second and third days after launch.  Science calibrations began     
      shortly after checkout, then were performed approximately once every    
      month.  The best sets of data for science calibrations were acquired    
      in April, May, and June 2005 and during the post-impact calibration     
      in July.  Calibration targets included the Moon, Earth, stars,          
      nebulae, and galactic clusters.  Comet 9P/Tempel 1 was not imaged       
      for scientific purposes during this phase.  Details of the cruise       
      calibrations were discussed in the 'Deep Impact Instrument              
      Calibration' paper by Klaasen, et al. (2006) [KLAASENETAL2006].

      Scientific data acquisition of comet 9P/Tempel 1 began and ended        
      during this phase.  On the approach to the comet, the objectives        
      were to determine the size of the nucleus, map the albedo, and          
      spectral variations of the surface, determine the rotational state      
      of the nucleus, and monitor the activity of the nucleus.  Other         
      objectives included identifying large-scale structure in the coma,      
      mapping the evolution of the inner coma over a full rotation period,    
      and searching for satellites to constrain the mass of the nucleus       
      (none were found).  Also, science calibrations were performed in        
      early May and June.  During approach, the HRII, HRIV, and MRI           
      instruments began acquiring data once every day, then every four        
      hours from 7 May through 30 June.  On 1 July, the sampling rate         
      changed to every two hours.  About 24 hours before impact, data         
      were acquired every hour until about 3 July 20:00 UT, nine hours        
      before impact.  Then, data were acquired every 30 minutes until         
      ten minutes before impact when the instruments began continuously       
      imaging the comet.                                                      
                                                                              
      During approach, the phase angle of the nucleus                         
      (sun-comet-spacecraft) increased by about 0.5 degree/day, beginning     
      at 28 degrees and reaching 60 degrees at impact minus seven days.       
      About three days from impact the HRIV instrument spatially resolved     
      the nucleus.  The HRII and MRI instruments did not resolve the          
      nucleus until the day before impact.  Due to pointing errors, the       
      HRII instrument was not imaging the comet until 20 June.                
                                                                              
      Twenty-four hours before the scheduled impact, the flyby craft          
      released the impactor at a distance of about 864,000 km from the        
      comet.  The ITS instrument began acquiring data, and the impactor       
      spacecraft transmitted the data over a S-band link to the flyby         
      spacecraft.  About 18 hours before impact, a small set of               
      calibration data (darks and internal stimulator frames) were            
      acquired for each instrument.  The pixel scales of the four             
      instruments as a function of time before impact were:

      The last ITS image was taken at 05:44:29 UT (at the impactor),          
      about 5 seconds before impact, with an estimated pixel scale of         
      0.5 meters/pixel.                                                       
                                                                              
      During the impact event, the instruments on the flyby craft             
      continuously recorded the development of the crater and start of        
      the ejecta flow.  At impact+804 seconds (05:57:58 UT), the flyby        
      space craft entered shield mode (SM) where the shields were pointed     
      in the direction of the spacecraft's velocity vector to protect the     
      instruments from dust impacts during closest approach to the comet.     
      During the impact event, pixel scales of the instruments were:

      The HRIV and MRI instruments stopped imaging immediately before         
      shield mode.  HRII continued (smeared) spectral imaging for about       
      50 seconds into shield mode.  The flyby spacecraft remained in          
      shield mode for about 24 minutes, through closest approach and          
      until the dust-impact hazard zone had been passed.  To exit             
      shield mode, the spacecraft performed an attitude maneuver over         
      several minutes, flipping over and pointing its instruments back        
      toward the nucleus.  Once in lookback attitude, the HRIV instrument     
      continued to image the impact site for another 12 hours.  The MRI       
      and HRII instruments continued to monitor the comet for 60 hours,       
      until 6 July 18:17 UT.  During lookback imaging, the pixel scales

      At impact, data determined to be less critical were stored in           
      the buffer memory of the two processors (A and B) on the flyby          
      spacecraft.  During lookback, the flyby craft transmitted these         
      stored data back to Earth.  Due to a planning oversight, the memory     
      of processor B was not cleared of data before lookback began.  This     
      caused some lookback images to never be recorded.  The last science     
      calibration started about two days after impact and continued to        
      13 July, which concluded the scientific activities of the mission.

      Since the flyby spacecraft and its instruments survived the             
      encounter with Tempel 1, a trajectory correction maneuver was           
      performed on 20 July 2005 to put the spacecraft into an orbit           
      for Earth return in late 2007, favoring an extended mission.            
      On 9 August 2005, the flyby craft was put into sleep mode.              
      On 10 February 2006, an aliveness test was performed on the             
      spacecraft.  The results of the wake-up and pointing activities

       velocity impact on the surface of comet 9P/Tempel 1;                   
                                                                              
    2) Determine properties of the surface layers, such as density,           
       strength, porosity and composition, from the resultant                 
       crater and its formation;                                              
                                                                              
    3) Study the relationship between the surface layers of a                 
       cometary nucleus and the possibly pristine materials of                
       the interior by comparing the interior of the crater                   
       with the surface prior to impact; and                                  
                                                                              
    4) Improve our understanding of the evolution of cometary                 
       nuclei, particularly their approach to dormancy, by                    
       comparing the interior and the surface.
