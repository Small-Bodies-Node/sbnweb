When the initial periodic comet list was compiled, a number of errors
were made in assigning the order of the serial numbers in the PDS
Names.  In 2005, a search of the IAUCs, MPECs and CBETs was done to
determine the true order in which the comets were designated as
periodic.  On January 13, 2006, the names in the list were corrected
to reflect this order.

This file gives a list of the changes that were made on that date.

Any subsequent changes are also indicated at the end of the file, with
a description of the change and why it was made.

Additional changes:

April 13, 2006: The comet originally named "P/2005 N2 Hergenrother 3"
was actually a re-discovery of the comet "P/1998 W2 Hergenrother 1".
The MPC subsequently assigned the official designation "168P/2005 N2"
and the PDS kept the original name "Hergenrother 1".  The name
"Hergenrother 3" was withdrawn.


Sept 11, 2009: The comet designated P/2003 A1 (IAUC 8044, 8053) remained
unnamed for nearly 2 years. It was finally given the name LINEAR 44 in Nov
2004 (IAUC 8430).  On Sept 11 2009, Kowalski independently discovered a comet
that was subsequently linked to LINEAR 44 and then to Pigott 1.  With these
connections, the comet was renamed Pigott-LINEAR-Kowalski 1 (IAUC 9072), and
the names Pigott 1 and LINEAR 44 were withdrawn.


May 8 2013:  During the compilation of the list, a number of provisional
designations were incorrectly included as the official designation (those
included were correct for the comet, but were from a different apparition).
These have been corrected to match those adopted by the MPC.

May 22, 2013: During the course of numbering some recent comets, it was found
that on two occasions, early observations of a comet had shown it to have a
periodic orbit, only to have subsequent observations lead to a solution that
was not periodic.

  C/2013 F3   McNaught 28
       Designated periodic        2013 Apr  9  (2013-G31)
       Listed as non-periodic     2013 Apr 23  (2013-H38)
 
  Because this object is fairly obscure (to the point of little additional
  photometry) it was felt that removing it from the list and allowing the
  serial number to be reassigned would not cause any significant problems.

  So C/2013 F3 McNaught 28 was removed from the list and the serial number 28
  was opened up for the next periodic McNaught comet.


  C/2013 G3   PanSTARRS 16
       Designated periodic        2013 Apr 14  (CBET 3472)
       Listed as non-periodic     2013 Apr 23  (2013-H38)
 
  This comet has the additional complexity that a PanSTARRS 17 was discovered
  before 16 was found to be non-periodic.  However, because both of these
  objects are fairly obscure (again, little additional photometry has been
  submitted for either) it was felt that removing 16 from the list and
  renumbering 17 to 16 would not cause any significant problems.

  So C/2013 G3 PanSTARRS 16 was removed from the list and P/2013 G4 PanSTARRS
  17 Was renumbered to PanSTARRS 16.  The serial number 17 was opened up for
  the next periodic PanSTARRS comet.



July 29, 2014: In conjunction with other lists, errors in were discovered and corrected

   P/2013 TL117 Lemmon 8 was changed to Lemmon 7.  Accidently skipped 7, so
   there is no conflict in the change.
 
   C/2011 P2 PanSTARRS 23 is the same comet as PanSTARRS 2, so this was a
   duplicate name for the same comet.  Unfortunately, the change propagates
   through the next five PanSTARRS comets.  A literature and web search was
   done to determine if changing the serial numbers would raise any
   confusion.  Only one object P/2013 P5 had any significant attention, as it
   is a main belt comet.  None of the references that were found referred to
   its serial number, however, so a change should not raise any confusion.
   The rest of the objects are fairly obscure, so renumbering shouldn't be a
   problem.
   Changes:
   C/2011 P2    PanSTARRS 23 --> Removed
   P/2013 P5    PanSTARRS 24 --> PanSTARRS 23  
   C/2013 P4    PanSTARRS 25 --> PanSTARRS 24  
   P/2013 T1    PanSTARRS 26 --> PanSTARRS 25  
   P/2013 W1    PanSTARRS 27 --> PanSTARRS 26  
   C/2013 W2    PanSTARRS 28 --> PanSTARRS 27  

These changes were made before updating the list for new comets that were
discovered between Jan and Jul 2014, so additions in that interval account
for these changes.


Oct 25, 2016:  Renaming of comet P/2015 PD229

On Feb 1, 2016, this comet was originally named ISON-Cameron.  In the OCT 25,
2016 MPEC-2016-U66 and all subsequent references, it is called Cameron-ISON.
No explanation is given for this.  The name ISON-Cameron 1 has been
withdrawn.

Mar 14, 2017
C/2016 VZ18 was briefly given the designation PanSTARRS 63, before it was
realized it was long period.  It has been removed from the list, and because
it was changed before any subsequent PanSTARRS comets were numbered, the
sequence is not affected.
